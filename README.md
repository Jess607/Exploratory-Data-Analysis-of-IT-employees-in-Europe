# Installation 
The code requires python versions of 3 and above and basic data wrangling knowledge using pandas and visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

# About The Project 
Being able to gain useful insights into the existing labor market in a region or area is a great benefit of data analysis. With the evolution of diverse data analytics practices and availability of data, this has proven rather easy than can be imagined. 

The aim of this project is to understand the dynamics of the European IT sector, how much employees are paid and how conditions differ between regions in Europe. Unfortunately, the dataset gathered did not sufficiently represent most countries in Europe but instead had most employees residing in the German towns of Berlin and Munich.

Regardless, analysis was carried out on this representative sample and inferences were drawn based on features that were studied.

# Data Gathering 
Data utilized was gathered from kaggle which is a useful repo for getting open datasets. 

# File Description 
The folder contains a jupyter notebook file that contains the python code implementation of the analysis.

# Limitations 
* The greatest limitation to the EDA process was that the sample data gathered was not sufficiently representative of the population being studied. Thus, full inferential results could not be drawn for certain cities in Europe unlike others.
